# Week 5-6 Individual Project

## Data sets
There are three datasets that will guide your journey:

Client Profiles [df_final_demo](data/raw/df_final_demo.csv): Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.

Digital Footprints [df_final_web_data](data/raw/df_final_web_data_combined.csv): A detailed trace of client interactions online.
Experiment Roster [df_final_experiment_clients]((data/raw/df_final_experiment_clients.csv)): A list revealing which clients were part of the grand experiment

## Client behavior analysis

Answered the following questions about demographics:

* Who are the primary clients using this online process?
* Are the primary clients younger or older, new or long-standing?
